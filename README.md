Website of e-commerce for girl hair accessories (my first solid, dinamic and responsive page with login).<br>
This project started as part of our sixth-semester project to put our knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, a bit of PHP, nothing of Bootstrap and local JSON pseudo-database management into practice.<br>
We had the assistance of two other classmates throughout the entire process.<br>
The development didn't kick off until we clarified guidelines, user stories, use cases, risk matrix, and tracked everything through Trello and a 'burn-down chart'.<br>
