Website of e-commerce for girl hair accessories (my first solid, dinamic and responsive page with login).
This project started as part of our sixth-semester project to put our knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, a bit of PHP, nothing of Bootstrap and local JSON pseudo-database management into practice.
We had the assistance of two other classmates throughout the entire process.
The development didn't kick off until we clarified guidelines, user stories, use cases, risk matrix, and tracked everything through Trello and a 'burn-down chart'.
